## Introduction
The purpose of the project concerns the design of an hypotetical operational management system for a company involved in the distribution of electrical energy, using control units equipped with sensors to measure the power output.
The system must acquire in real time the data from the control units, monitor them, and handle any anomalies.
In the event of an anomaly, the central technical service manages it by notifying an operator to repair the fault.
